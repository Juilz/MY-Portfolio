# MY-Portfolio
ðŸŒŸ Excited to Share My Portfolio! ðŸŒŸ

I am thrilled to announce that I have completed my portfolio, showcasing my journey as a Data Analyst. It features a range of projects, including my Customer Segmentation Analysis dashboard and insights from my internship at AK Infopark.

Through these experiences, I've honed my skills in data visualization, SQL, and web development, and I'm eager to continue exploring the world of data. I invite you to check it out and share your thoughts!
